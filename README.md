# Building a Stock Analysis System with Buy/Sell Recommendations

## Description
This notebook implements a rule-based stock analysis system that fetches financial data for a given company (e.g., AAPL) from multiple APIs, processes the data, calculates a score based on financial metrics, and provides a Buy/Sell recommendation with reasoning. The system uses weighted scoring logic to evaluate the company's performance and generate actionable insights.
While the current implementation is deterministic and rule-based, it serves as a foundation for creating an AI agent by adding autonomy, learning capabilities, and natural language interaction.
