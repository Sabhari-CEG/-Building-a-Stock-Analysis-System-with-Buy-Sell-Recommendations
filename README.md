# Building a Stock Analysis System with Buy/Sell Recommendations

## Description
This notebook implements a rule-based stock analysis system that fetches financial data for a given company (e.g., AAPL) from multiple APIs, processes the data, calculates a score based on financial metrics, and provides a Buy/Sell recommendation with reasoning. The system uses weighted scoring logic to evaluate the company's performance and generate actionable insights.
While the current implementation is deterministic and rule-based, it serves as a foundation for creating an AI agent by adding autonomy, learning capabilities, and natural language interaction.

## 1. Prerequisites
Install required libraries:
### pip install transformers requests

## 2. Input Parameters
1. API Key: Used to authenticate API calls.
2. Company Name: The stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL) for which the analysis is performed.

## 3. Workflow
### Step 1: Fetch Data from APIs <br>
The notebook fetches data from 7 APIs provided by Financial Modeling Prep: <br>
API 1: Real-time stock price and basic metrics. <br>
API 5, API 6, API 7: Historical financial statements (income statement, cash flow statement). <br>

### Step 2: Consolidate Historical Data
Combines data from APIs (e.g., revenue, EPS, free cash flow) into a unified structure using the build_historical_data function. <br>

### Step 3: Calculate Growth Rates
Computes year-over-year growth rates for key metrics: <br>
1. Revenue Growth
2. Net Income Growth
3. EPS Growth
4. Free Cash Flow Growth

### Formula:
## growth = (latest_value - previous_value) / previous_value

### Step 4: Assign Weights and Calculate Score
Assigns weights to various factors:

weights = { <br>
    "pe_ratio": -0.2, <br>
    "eps_growth": 0.3, <br>
    "revenue_growth": 0.2, <br>
    "free_cash_flow_growth": 0.2, <br>
    "price_vs_50_avg": 0.1, <br>
    "price_vs_200_avg": 0.1 <br>
} <br>

Normalizes individual scores for each factor to ensure they are between 0 and 1. <br>
Computes the final weighted score: <br>

score = ( <br>
    weights["pe_ratio"] * pe_score + <br>
    weights["eps_growth"] * eps_growth_score + <br>
    weights["revenue_growth"] * revenue_growth_score + <br>
    weights["free_cash_flow_growth"] * free_cash_flow_score + <br>
    weights["price_vs_50_avg"] * price_vs_50_avg_score + <br>
    weights["price_vs_200_avg"] * price_vs_200_avg_score <br>
 ) <br>

### Step 5: Make Decision (Buy/Sell)
If the final score is greater than 0.5, the decision is "Buy". Otherwise, it is "Sell".

### Step 6: Provide Reasoning
Generates human-readable reasoning for the decision based on key metrics:

## How to Convert This Into an AI Agent
To transform this rule-based system into an AI agent, you need to add the following features:
### 1. Autonomy
1. Automate API calls and analysis at regular intervals or based on triggers (e.g., stock price changes).
2. Use event-driven architecture to fetch data dynamically without manual input.
### 2. Learning Capability
1. Replace rule-based scoring with machine learning models trained on historical data to predict Buy/Sell decisions.
2. Use supervised learning with labeled datasets (e.g., past stock performance and decisions).
### 3. Natural Language Interaction
1. Integrate a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT-3/4 to allow users to interact with the system in natural language.
2. Example Query: "Should I buy AAPL stock today?"
3. LLM Response: "Based on our analysis, we recommend selling AAPL due to weak EPS growth and overvaluation."

## Proposed System Architecture
The proposed system consists of the following components:
### 1. Data Collection Module
1. Fetches real-time data from APIs (e.g., Financial Modeling Prep).
2. Collects historical financial statements (e.g., revenue, EPS) for trend analysis.
3. Incorporates news articles or social media posts for sentiment analysis.
### 2. Data Preprocessing Module
1. Consolidates raw data from multiple sources into a unified structure.
2. Normalizes metrics (e.g., revenue growth rates) for machine learning models.
3. Filters noise from sentiment data using NLP techniques.
### 3. Machine Learning Module
1. Predicts Buy/Sell decisions using supervised learning models trained on historical data.
2. Features include:
Revenue growth <br>
EPS growth <br>
Free cash flow growth <br>
Sentiment scores <br>
3. Models considered: 
Random Forests <br>
Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) <br>
Neural Networks <br>
### 4. Sentiment Analysis Module
1. Uses pre-trained NLP models like FinBERT to analyze sentiment from news articles or social media.
2. Outputs a sentiment score (-1 to +1), which is integrated into the decision-making process.
### 5. Decision-Making Module
1. Combines weighted scores from the Machine Learning module and Sentiment Analysis module.
2. Provides a final score (0â€“1) indicating the strength of the Buy/Sell recommendation.
### 6. Natural Language Interaction Module
1. Uses GPT-based models (e.g., GPT-3/4) to generate human-readable explanations for decisions.
2. Allows users to interact with the system via natural language queries (e.g., "Why should I buy AAPL?").
   
## Methodology
### Phase 1: Data Collection
1. Identify reliable APIs for financial data (e.g., Financial Modeling Prep).
2. Collect historical data for training machine learning models.
3, Scrape news articles or social media posts for sentiment analysis.

### Phase 2: Model Development
1. Train regression/classification models using historical financial metrics.
2. Develop a hybrid scoring mechanism that combines financial metrics and sentiment scores.

### Phase 3: System Integration
1. Integrate all modules into a unified pipeline.
2. Automate API calls and preprocessing steps.

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. Backtest the system using historical stock data to evaluate accuracy.
2. Compare performance with baseline rule-based systems.

## Expected Outcomes
A fully autonomous AI agent capable of: <br>
1. Fetching real-time financial data dynamically.
2. Analyzing trends using machine learning models.
3. Incorporating public sentiment into decision-making.
4. Providing human-readable explanations for its recommendations.
5. Improved accuracy compared to rule-based systems due to adaptive learning capabilities.
6. Enhanced user experience through natural language interaction.

## Future Work
1. Extend the system to handle portfolio optimization rather than individual stock recommendations.
2. Incorporate macroeconomic indicators (e.g., interest rates, inflation) into the analysis pipeline.
3. Use reinforcement learning to improve decision-making based on feedback loops (e.g., profit/loss after following recommendations).

## Conclusion
This research proposal outlines the development of an intelligent AI agent that combines financial metrics, sentiment analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing into a unified system for stock market analysis and recommendation generation. By addressing existing limitations in rule-based systems and leveraging advanced AI techniques, this project aims to create a robust tool that empowers investors with actionable insights in real-time markets.
